Here’s my trail-tested best hiking gear list for 2018, updated regularly. I only recommend hiking gear that I’ve used over hundreds of miles. I don’t post any paid reviews and don’t waste your time with gear that I try but isn’t up to snuff.

For most gear on this site, I link to REI, and when you click on the link and purchase the item, I receive a very small affiliate commission. I use that commission to pay for website hosting and other costs of running HikingGuy.

So please use the links on this page to buy your gear. Think of it as an easy way to support free hiking guides for everyone.

And don’t forget, use your gear at home first on a simple walk and get used to it before you take it out on the trail','picture' => 'news-2.jpg','date' => '2019-01-14 13:51:20','archive' => 'N'),
